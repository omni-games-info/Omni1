# Omni1

Omni1 is a core tool in the **Omni Games Ecosystem**, designed for creating high-precision 1G1R (1 Game 1 Region) ROM sets.

It allows users to generate **clean, optimized ROM collections** by selecting a single game per region while ensuring consistency with metadata in the `OMNI_DAT` database. Omni1 also pulls additional metadata from the `OMNI_TITLES` database, enabling users to filter games by unique attributes such as **genre, developer, or platform**. Omni1 is fully online, so there is no need to install Python or other software, and users do not need to manage versions or updates. This makes it easy for collectors and preservationists to create perfectly curated ROM sets efficiently.

- **Automatic Metadata Tracking** – Uses the `OMNI_DAT` database to ensure all ROMs are accurate and up-to-date.  
- **Enhanced Filtering** – Pulls data from `OMNI_TITLES` to allow filtering by unique attributes like genre, developer, or platform.
